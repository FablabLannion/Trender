## Modes

The Trender supports several modes. You can use it as:
 * Demo
 * Timekeeper
 * Notification system (twitter, jenkins)

By default the Trender is in Notification mode.

You can switch from Notification to Timekeeper mode by putting *1* in the mode
window. A green light will blink to indicate that the mode has been changed.

Once in timekeeper mode, you may come back to notification mode by putting *0*
in the mode window.

### Timekeeper

A timekeeper is often referred to as a time clock, which tracks time. The
Trender allows to set 3 fully customizable thresholds.

From the WiFi configure menu, once you set *1* in the mode window, come back to
the main page. A new menu will be displayed.
